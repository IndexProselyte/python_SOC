# Spyware programming project
Created for a cybersecurity/programming competition.
This is the first time we made a project of this magnitude and complexity so it contains many unstable and broken functions. 
So i apologize if you needed to clean your eyes after reading thru it. 


# Project goals
For this work, our goal was to create a program that would serve as a "Hacking Center" where a hacker would have the opportunity to manage and monitor an infected device by pressing a button and typing a few commands.
We wanted to create two programs:
  • The first main program for managing an infected device
  • A second program serving as the virus itself sending information to the main program.
  
The information we wanted to get from the victim was supposed to be critical and privacy-infringing:
  • IP address – And its rough location
  • Pressing any keys on the keyboard
  • Downloading files and information about file paths from the victim
  • Possible open Ports on the computer
  

Yeh that's about it.
